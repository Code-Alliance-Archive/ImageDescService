Property Issues and the Poet Image Accessibility Project</span>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Version 1.0, as of January 8, 2013</P>
<span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#345A8A'>Overview</span>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The Poet online software is a tool
for enhancing the accessibility of images in eBooks with image
descriptions, tactile graphics and additional accessibility
information.  It was developed by Benetech with funding from the U.S.
Department of Education.   It displays the text of an uploaded eBook
as well as the images, and then offers the ability to write image
descriptions, and add important accessibility information known as
metadata.  Metadata might include such important information such as
whether a given image is copyrighted, contains important content or
is simply visual “eye-candy,” or if it is a mathematical
equation.   We also expect, in the future, to support the addition of
special digital versions of the images, such as “scaled vector
graphic” (SVG) files, suitable for the creation of a tactile
graphic on a specialized printer or special paper.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Using Poet the image accessibility
enhancements created can then be incorporated into the original book
files and made available through an eBook distribution system such as
the Bookshare online library for people with print disabilities. The
user can also download the new accessibility information directly
from Poet. In either case, the final enhanced eBook may be used
as-is, converted into another specialized format (such as an audio
book), provided to another qualified person or organization, or used
to create a physically accessible book (such as a version of the book
in braille and tactile graphics or in large print).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The primary goal of Poet is to make
it easier for authors, publishers, libraries, schools and
transcribers to make more useful eBooks to assist people with
disabilities.  People who are blind are unable to see images
visually, so if the images hold important information, as they often
do in a textbook, someone sighted needs to make that image
accessible.  This is often accomplished by describing it or providing
an alternative form that can be explored tactually.  Image
descriptions and metadata, in particular, add value to the images
they describe by providing text keywords that make it easier to find
images on certain topics.  Just as curb cuts benefit wheelchair users
as well as people using wheeled luggage, these image descriptions are
a universal design feature which benefits people with disabilities as
well as those without.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The legal status of creating and
using image descriptions of copyrighted images or diagrams that do
not belong to the describer is a complex question, the answer to
which may depend on a number of factors.  Although Benetech’s
Bookshare online library, and its volunteers and staff, clearly
qualify under the Section 121 copyright exception in the US when
delivering image description enhanced eBooks, Benetech’s goal is to
benefit additional qualified people (and the organizations and
schools that serve them) with its image description work. Technically
any image description created by describing the image in words is
likely to be a derivative of the original work under the copyright
laws.   However, in nearly every case of creation of accessibility
features or functions, such derivatives are not considered an
infringement because they are protected or covered by the copyright
concept of fair use found in Section 107 of Title 17 U.S.C., the
Copyright statutes in the United States.  We have also committed to
the U.S. Department of Education to make these tools and descriptions
available to everybody in the accessibility field, from the braille
transcriber to the teacher to the publisher, all of whom are trying
to make eBooks more accessible by readers with visual and reading
disabilities.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The goal of this Memo is to suggest
legal notices covering these legal issues in two different contexts:</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Beneficent Technology, Inc.
(“Benetech”), the developer of the Poet software, has created
Poet to be used to add accessibility features to otherwise
inaccessible content, for the benefit of people with disabilities. 
Users of this software are solely responsible for determining whether
the addition, creation or modification of image descriptions or other
accessibility features are legally permissible.  Benetech does not
condone, endorse or support illegal copying of copyrighted or

all users at the time of creating an account on the “Poet” site]</span>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Beneficent Technology, Inc.
(“Benetech”), the developer of the Poet software and operator of
this Poet website (the “Website”), has created this website and
the materials available on the Website to be used to add
accessibility features to otherwise inaccessible image content, for
educational purposes and especially for the benefit of people with
disabilities.  
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><B>Background.  </B>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">More and more published content
contains images, charts and graphics.  Such images are often more
difficult to understand than plain text, especially for people who
have difficulty using images because of disability, such as blind
people.  The Poet tool was created by the DIAGRAM Center, a research
and development effort of experts and organizations in the field of
accessibility, in order to make it easier and less costly to add
image descriptions and digital tactile graphics files to inaccessible
images.  The Poet tool accepts the upload of electronic books
(eBooks) that include images, and provides the ability to add or
modify image descriptions and related metadata (i.e., the target age
or grade of the material), as well as add or link to a version of the
image suitable for producing a tactile graphic.  An improved eBook
can then be downloaded by the user who uploaded the initial eBook, as
well as being made available via Bookshare for use by print disabled
individuals who would benefit from accessibility enhancements, or to
produce accessible versions of such books in other forms, such as the
creation of braille versions of materials. The Poet tool also
provides users with access to previously created image descriptions,
to allow new image descriptions to be created more quickly by finding
and editing an existing image description on a similar topic (say, a
diagram of a heart or a graph of a mathematical function).  The Poet
tool is intended to improve accessibility for all people around the
world, but it is not intended to facilitate copyright infringement. 
Benetech will, in appropriate cases, assist publishers and copyright
owners in investigations of apparent instances of infringing uses. By
