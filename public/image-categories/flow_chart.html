<h2>Guidelines:</h2>
<br>



<ul>
	<li>Flow charts are a common method of presenting information and one of the most difficult images to describe. </li>
	<li>Simple flow charts can be converted into nested lists with good results. Present the "boxes" as numbers and the possible transitions as sub-bullets.</li>
	<li>For some people, combining description with a tactile version of a flow chart facilitates comprehension.</li>
	<li>It is not necessary to describe the visual attributes of the charts, e.g. yellow boxes, curved arrows, etc., unless there is an explicit need such as an exam question referring to these attributes. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<br>

 The figure is a flow chart with eight labeled boxes linked by arrows.
<br>


<br>

 The chart is multi-directional. At each step, arrows point forward to one or more boxes and back to the previous box or boxes.
<br>


<br>

 Here the flow chart is described as lists in which the possible next steps are listed beneath each box label.

<h2>Guidelines:</h2>
<br>



<ul>
	<li>Visually, a flow chart can convey complex relationships almost instantly. In this example, one can quickly see that the main process can begin in three different ways and that there are two other processes that are closely related but not directly connected.</li>
	<li>Begin with a brief overview, explaining the distinct elements of the image, including if it has multiple starting points, additional lists, etc.</li>
	<li>Describe each section of the flow chart linearly, using nested lists as an organizing tool.</li>
	<li>Combining description with a tactile version of a flow chart may provide increased access.</li>
	<li>It is not necessary to describe the visual attributes of the charts, e.g. yellow boxes, curved arrows, etc., unless there is an explicit need such as an exam question referring to these attributes. </li>
	<li>It may be helpful to <a href="/experience_learn/educational_media/stemdx/alternate-approach-for-flow-chart" title="Effective Practices for Description of Science Content within Digital Talking Books">explicitly state when the different lines merge</a>.</li>

<h2>Flow Chart with Complex Paths</h2>
<br>

<br>


<br>



<h2>Guidelines:</h2>
<br>



<ul>
	<li>At first, this flow chart may seem impossible to describe. Even visually, the process it illustrates is not immediately obvious and appears rather complex.  </li>
	<li>Convert the flow chart into a single linear list, with the possible next steps of each box or item nested below it.</li>
	<li>A tactile version may add accessibility.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<br>



<h2>Description:</h2>
<br>

 The figure is a flow chart with 7 stages of action. 3 types of lines represent different transitions between the stages of action.
<br>


<br>

 The lines are labeled: Expected transitions, Non-problematic unexpected transitions, and Problematic unexpected transitions.
<br>


<br>

 Here the flow chart is described as a nested list in which possible transitions are listed beneath each stage of action.
<br>


<br>



<ol>
	<li>Forming the goal

<ul>
	<li>Expected transition to Forming the intention</li>

</ul> </li>
	<li>Evaluating the outcome

<ul>
	<li>If intention is maintained, and a new action is required then Expected transition to Specifying the action</li>
	<li>If a new intention is warranted then Expected transition to Forming the intention</li>

<h2>Process Diagram as Flow Chart</h2>
<br>

 <img src="/images/95.jpg" alt="Diagram of Krebs Cycle" title="Diagram of Krebs Cycle" class="rte-img" height="430" width="317">
<br>


<br>



<h2>Guidelines:</h2>
<br>



<ul>
	<li>This illustration shows a process. One way to make this accessible is to lay out the steps in a list, similar to the recommendation for flow charts. </li>
	<li>Again, the illustration itself is colorful and visually interesting but it doesn't provide additional information beyond the data.</li>
</ul>
<br>


<br>



<h2>Description:</h2>
<br>

 The Krebs Cycle is depicted as a linear reaction which leads downward into a cyclical reaction. Here, the steps of the reactions are presented as lists.
<br>


<br>



<ol>
	<li>Linear Reaction

<ul>
	<li>Pyruvic acid, a 3-carbon compound.</li>
	<li>One carbon molecule is lost as part of a CO2 molecule.</li>
	<li>An NAD-positive molecule enters the reaction, then leaves as NADH.</li>
	<li>A 2-carbon acetyl group remains.</li>
	<li>Coenzyme A, or CoA, joins the 2-carbon acetyl group to form Acetyl CoA.</li>
	<li>CoA leaves the reaction as it delivers the acetyl group to the circular reaction.</li>
</ul> </li>
	<li>Circular Reaction

<ul>
	<li>The two-carbon acetyl group joins a four-carbon compound to form a 6-carbon compound, citric acid.</li>
	<li>A carbon is lost as CO2.</li>
	<li>NAD-positive enters, then leaves as NADH.</li>
	<li>A 5-carbon compound remains.</li>
	<li>another carbon is lost as CO2.</li>
	<li>NAD-positive comes in and leaves as NADH.</li>
	<li>ADP comes in and leaves as ATP.</li>
	<li>A four-carbon compound remains.</li>
	<li> FAD comes in and leaves as FADH2.</li>
	<li>NAD-positive comes in and leaves as NADH.</li>
	<li>Back again at the top of the circular reaction, a two-carbon acetyl group from the linear reaction enters, forming the 6-carbon citric acid at the beginning of the cycle.</li>
</ul> </li>
</ol>
