<b> Standard Diagram or Illustration</b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Example (illustration making a comparison):</b>

<h1><img src="/images/image016.png" align=left alt="Description: Diagram of embryos" title="" class="rte-img" height="106" width="185"></h1>
  <li> An illustration captioned “Early Embryos” compares the Gill arches from a fish, reptile, and bird. All embryos are shown in side view.  </li>
  <li> The fish embryo is long and narrow. Its head is small, round, and contains gill arches. A large flap extends to the left, from below the head to the middle of the embryo.</li>
  <li>  The reptile embryo is longer and fatter than the fish embryo. Its head is bent forward and twice as large as that of the fish embryo. The flap on the left is half as long, but there are twice as many gill arches as the fish embryo.</li>
  <li>  The bird embryo is more curved than the fish embryo, but not as long or curved as the reptile embryo. The head is almost as large as the reptile embryo, but has fewer gill arches. A flap the same size as the reptile extends to the left.</li>

<b>Guidelines:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Provide the title and caption of the diagram or illustration</li>
  <li>Separate the information using a bulleted list, nested list, or data tables</li>
  <li>Give a general overview, then provide the detail or information as if looking at the diagram from left to right, top to bottom, or from a central focal point</li>
  <li>If illustrating a comparison, describe the same features to compare between each object</li>
  <li>If the caption in the text (not as part of the image) provides some information, only focus on what is not already included in the caption</li>
</ul>
