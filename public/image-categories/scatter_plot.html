<h2>Guidelines:</h2>
<br>



<ul>
	<li>Scatter plots are among the more difficult graphs to describe, especially if there is a need to make specific data point accessible. </li>
	<li>Provide the title and axis labels. </li>
	<li>Identify the image as a scatter plot and focus on the change of concentration.</li>
	<li>If it is necessary to be more specific, convert the data into an accessible table.</li>
</ul>
<br>



<h2>Description:</h2>
<br>

 The graph is a scatter plot, entitled "Rainfall and Plant Growth."
<br>


<br>

 The horizontal X axis shows Average Rainfall ranging from zero to four thousand, in units of millimeters per year, in increments of one thousand.
<br>


<br>

 The vertical Y axis shows Plant Tissue Production in units of grams per meter squared per year, ranging from zero to three thousand, in increments of five hundred.
<br>


<br>

 The graph has approximately 85 points scattered in a pattern beginning in the lower-left corner where Plant Tissue Production and Average Rainfall are the lowest. The pattern extends toward the upper-right corner where Plant Tissue Production and Average Rainfall are the highest.
<br>


<br>

 The majority of points are concentrated in the lower-left corner and diminish in concentration as the pattern extends toward the upper-right corner.
