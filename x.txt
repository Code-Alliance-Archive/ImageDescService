Feature: Daisy Book
  
  As a normal user,
  I want to be able to upload a daisy book (zip file)
  So that I can edit the image descriptions

  Scenario: Upload page should have the necessary content # features/daisy_book.feature:7
    When I go to the daisy upload page                    # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:48
    Then I should see "unencrypted Daisy book (zip) file" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:118

  Scenario: Hitting upload with no book selected           # features/daisy_book.feature:11

    And I should see "Must specify a book file to process" # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:118

  Scenario: Uploading a non-zip file                                  # features/daisy_book.feature:17

    And I attach the file "features/fixtures/NonXMLFile" to "book"    # features/step_definitions/web_steps.rb:101

  Scenario: Downloading a Daisy book with descriptions                                                                                                                                                           # features/daisy_book.feature:86
